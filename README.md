# FaultTolerantTaskOffloadingSimulation
This project proposes a DRL-based fault-tolerant task offloading method for Mobile Edge-Cloud Computing. Using a DDPG algorithm, it minimizes latency and enhances reliability for delay-sensitive tasks in dynamic environments while adapting to resource fluctuations and failure rates.
